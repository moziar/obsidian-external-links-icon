## Performance
This plugin is designed for high performance. 

Every image has been meticulously optimized, with most displayed in `SVG` format. 

Some icons are adaptive to the _Base color scheme_ and will automatically adjust their highlight color accordingly.

## Installation
Use the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to install this plugin.

1. Install [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) Obsidian plugin
2. Use `BRAT: Plugins: Add a beta plugin for testing` command to install a new plugin 
3. Enter `moziar/obsidian-external-links-icon` on the popup window
4. Enjoy

## Setting
By default, both URL Scheme and WebSite icon are enabled. You could disable any of them via the **Style Setting plugin**.

There are two different Obsidian icons to help users better distinguish between Obsidian web links and note links.

Obsidian Note Link icon is disabled by default. You can enable either _internal link_, _external link_, or both, or disable them entirely — it all depends on your workflow.
